   When the function is expanded in the makefile, FUNC will be invoked with
   the appropriate arguments.

   The return value of FUNC must be either NULL, in which case it expands to
   the empty string, or a pointer to the result of the expansion in a string
   created by gmk_alloc().  GNU Make will free the memory when it's done.

   MIN_ARGS is the minimum number of arguments the function requires.
   MAX_ARGS is the maximum number of arguments (or 0 if there's no maximum).
   MIN_ARGS and MAX_ARGS may not exceed 255.

   The FLAGS value may be GMK_FUNC_DEFAULT, or one or more of the following
   flags OR'd together:

     GMK_FUNC_NOEXPAND:  the arguments to the function will be not be expanded
                         before FUNC is called.
     GMK_FUNC_DIRECTIVE: adds func as as 'directive' instead of a 'function';
                         directives are line-level constructs like `include` or
                         `load`.
